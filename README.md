Push_swap
Overview

The Push_swap project requires you to sort data within a stack using a limited set of operations while minimizing the number of moves. To succeed, you'll need to manipulate various sorting algorithms and select the most appropriate solution for optimal data sorting.
Project Details

    Sorting Algorithm: Implemented an optimized version of a bit-shifting radix sort.
    Score: Achieved a score of 90/100, sufficient for passing the assessment.

This project challenges your algorithmic skills and understanding of data structures, pushing you to find efficient solutions for sorting tasks.
